# Team Humanity

The world has a number of challenges.

People are capable of great things.

The purpose of this project is to encourage you to take ownership over large world challenges that impact your life - if you're a highly capable individual, there's a good chance that you can make an impact.

The single most important thing for you to do, if you are extremely driven, curious and ethical, is for you to identify the single largest issue facing *you* and solve that. If it faces you, others are probably facing it too.

As a next step, consider going on a quiet retreat to think about world problems and which ones are meaningful to you.
